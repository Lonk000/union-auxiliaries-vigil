## THE DROP

*"Nothing says 'trial by fire' quite like fighting for your life in the debris of your dropship. Make sure you make it out of this alive."*

# Objectives: 
- Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.

# Parameters: 
- Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes

- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.
