  "text_appearance": "<p>180cm, athletic build is framed by a rugged, off-white flight jacket and a reinforced tactical harness. He has piercing slate-grey eyes and charcoal-colored hair kept in a practical, wind-swept crop that stays clear of his face during high-intensity maneuvers. His features are marked by faint, silvery scarring along his jawline—a permanent reminder of early mineral exposure from his home world’s particulate-heavy atmosphere.</p>",
  "notes": "",
  "history": "<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>Sion Kesyk was born on <strong>Mercade (IK-66)</strong>, a mid-sized terrestrial world on the extreme fringe of the <strong>Dawnline Shore </strong>within the <strong>Ikaros </strong>system. While the Karrakin Trade Baronies and Harrison Armoury maneuvered for dominance in the sector, <strong>Mercade </strong>fell into a jurisdictional black hole, allowing an unscrupulous third-party corporation to exploit the planet's atmosphere. For years, the corporation operated with total impunity, enforcing bonded labour on a population forced to rely on company air filtration just to survive the planet's toxic air.&nbsp;</p><p>His world’s liberation was finally triggered by a specialized scout wing of the <strong>Department of Justice and Human Rights (DoJ/HR)</strong>. These scouts bypassed corporate blockades to document the systematic Pillar violations, providing the evidence needed for <strong>Union </strong>to dismantle the corporate board and integrate <strong>Mercade </strong>as a protected <strong>Union </strong>member-state.</p><p>Soon after, Sion enlisted in the <strong>DoJ/HR</strong> to join the same division that saved his people. Now serving as a <strong>Union Scout</strong>, his mission is to infiltrate the most remote reaches of space to identify <strong>Utopian Pillar</strong> violations before they escalate.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><h2><strong>NHP Profile: ORION</strong></h2><p>Born from the chaotic electronic feedback of salvaged corporate sensors and a cascading <strong>NHP</strong>, <strong>ORION</strong> is a spontaneous manifestation—a \"wild\" entity that Sion Kesyk chose to stabilize and shackle himself rather than report for cleansing.</p><p><strong>NHP Class: ARGUS</strong> <strong>Class<br>Origin:</strong> A newly manifested class, <strong>ARGUS</strong>-class NHPs are paracausal entities with an effectively infinite capacity for parallel sensory processing, derived from a <strong>NOAH</strong>-class <strong>NHP</strong>. The name reflects the \"all-seeing\" hundred-eyed giant of myth, a nod to the NHP’s primary purpose: ensuring that nothing goes unseen. Emerging from the dense data-streams of the Dawnline Shore, this class excels at identifying the \"blind spots\" that Union’s enemies rely upon.</p><p><strong>NHP Name: ORION<br></strong>Sion named this specific instance <strong>ORION</strong>, after the Great Hunter of the stars. It serves as a personal anchor for Sion, designed to be a \"Hunter of Truth\" rather than a mere data-sifter. Because it manifested from Sion's own equipment during a period of deep-space isolation, its subjectivity is intrinsically linked to his own need for a vigilant, stoic partner.</p><p><strong>Personality: The Steady Navigator<br>ORION </strong>does not possess the frantic energy of a typical combat AI. Instead, it is characterized by an immense, patient stillness. Sion tailored <strong>ORION </strong>to be a \"second set of eyes\" that never blinks and a \"second mind\" that never tires of the dark.</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Anchor:</strong> Sion programmed <strong>ORION </strong>with a personality that is grounded and slightly dry. Because a scout spends months in isolation, <strong>ORION </strong>is designed to be conversational and \"human-adjacent\" to prevent Sion from succumbing to madness or the isolation of long-range transit.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Filter:</strong> <strong>ORION </strong>acts as a moral and logical filter. It is capable of independent thought and learning, and Sion has encouraged it to challenge his own biases. If Sion becomes too focused on a single target, <strong>ORION </strong>is the one to remind him of the bigger picture.</p></li></ul><p>In the field, Sion and Orion operate as a single unit. While Sion uses his expertise to scout and skirmish, <strong>ORION </strong>handles the \"heavy lifting\"—sifting through noise, predicting enemy movements, and keeping their mech's signature invisible to enemy sensors.</p><p><br></p>",
