Like most Lumont heirs, his childhood revolved around trade arbitration, private security forces, and the unspoken truth that wealth in the Baronies is defended as often as it is negotiated. Education was impeccable, emotions were optional, and failure was remembered for generations.</p><p>The Lumonts were not warlords—but they owned the people who were. Matthew learned early that authority didn’t need to shout. It only needed leverage.</p><p>Exposure to <strong>Union space and ideology</strong> during joint security operations cracked that certainty. Union’s emphasis on post-scarcity ethics, shared governance, and transparent command structures clashed violently with Karrakin feudal pragmatism—but it also offered something Matthew had never been promised: <strong>merit without inheritance</strong>. Against family expectation, he entered Union’s military-adjacent training pipelines, trading heraldry for serial numbers.</p><p>Becoming a <strong>Lancer</strong> finalized the break. Union doesn’t care who your ancestors were, only what you can hold, fix, and protect when everything goes wrong. Matthew earned the callsign <strong>“Stonemason”</strong> for his methodical combat style and refusal to panic under pressure: slow advances, solid firing lines, and battlefield solutions that <em>stay solved</em>.</p><p>To Union, Stonemason is a reliable pilot with a talent for structural warfare and command cohesion.<br>To the Baronies, he is an asset that walked away and might one day come back wearing different colors.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"Noble","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"5836fc4a-0d7f-4ff8-b493-a8199224c0b8","name":"It's All Here","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":16,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu Jan 29 2026 12:38:46 GMT-0700 (Mountain Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:88c19765-1ca2-c92a-0af8-94a32133939a/npc/Screenshot_27-9-2024_102911_retrogrademinis.com.jpeg","loadouts":[{"id":"b67a246f-0628-424a-a238-fb32b489c452","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_custom_paint_job","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_type_3_projected_shield","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Type-3 Projected Shield traps and denies incoming projectiles by projecting an aggressive, superpositional anti-ballistic barrier."}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_shotgun","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
