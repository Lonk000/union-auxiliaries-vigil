Skeletal and connective tissues show reinforcement beyond human norms. All adaptations are stable and non-degenerative. No corrective intervention required.</p><p><strong>Neurological &amp; Cognitive Load:</strong><br>OHM interface stability remains exceptional under sustained high-output conditions. Neural response patterns indicate strong resistance to feedback shock and sensory overload. Reaction latency is slightly reduced compared to light-frame pilots; performance remains optimal for heavy platforms.</p><p><strong>Psychological Profile:</strong><br>Low emotional volatility. Flat affect with controlled expression. No indicators of dissociation, aggression, dysregulation, or identity fragmentation. Subject displays strong self-concept and operational focus.</p><p><strong>OHM Integration Notes:</strong><br>Synchronization remains stable at elevated stress thresholds. Subject demonstrates natural aptitude for battlefield anchoring, threat saturation management, and long-duration engagements. Non-baseline physiology presents no adverse OHM interaction.</p><p><strong>Risk Factors:</strong><br>Low. Subject shows a tendency toward self-reliance and extended operational endurance beyond recommended limits. Enforced rest cycles advised.</p><p><strong>Clearance Status:</strong><br>- <strong>APPROVED FOR ACTIVE DEPLOYMENT</strong><br>- <strong>AUTHORIZED FOR HEAVY FIRE SUPPORT FRAMES</strong></p>",

  "history": "<p>Takeda Hikinata is built like an emplacement and moves like he knows it. Augmented physiology—horns, tail, reinforced musculature—marks him as nonstandard, but he treats it as background noise. Whatever was done to him, it stuck, and he learned how to make it useful.</p><p>Her callsign comes from his spec-ops years: calm, immovable, and reliably cold when things go loud. Hikinata doesn’t posture or escalate. He waits, absorbs pressure, and answers with overwhelming force once the field is fully measured.</p><p>In a frame, he favors heavy fire support for the same reason he favored anchoring roles on foot: control. he doesn’t chase momentum. She denies it to everyone else.</p><p>If <em>Fridge</em> is deployed, the engagement will slow down—whether the enemy wants it to or not.</p>",

Reliable galactic standards, the GMS T-1 line is the most widely used mech-scale line of weaponry across the galaxy. Echoing the Everest’s design notes, T-1 weapons are simply designed, with few (if any) moving parts, intended to be used in or adaptable to any environment.",
